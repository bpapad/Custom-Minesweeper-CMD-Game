# Custom-Minesweeper-CMD-Game
A custom minesweeper-like game written on C++


C++

With no graphics implemented and by using basic characters (+,P,F, etc) a field is generated filled with mines which the Player (P) must cross in order to advance to the next stage. The fruit (F) along the way grant additional points if the player collects them. With each stage passed, the next one gets bigger with more mines.

Easy mode       -> Mine Detector ON!  -> Scans around the player all the time and finds adjacent mines
Impossible mode -> Mine Detector OFF! -> No explanation needed
